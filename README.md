# EmailTemplate
A quick and dirty project for class, this is an Android app that allows users to save, edit, and send simple email templates. It has features like sorting templates into Categories, the ability to Favorite most used templates, and the Recent tab. It's meant for commonly recurring situations like asking for a sick day and telling your group members you'll be late.
